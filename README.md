# Hand in Hand - Web Development 

This is the starter code for the Youth Hand in Hand Web Development class.

We will be using Github Pages to create a fully functional website. To see an example of what this starter website looks like, click the link below:

All of the stuff that you see being displayed in the website is coded directly here, on Github. This makes Github a very powerful tool to create your own webpage. 

For example, take a look at the [index.html](https://github.com/yangben000/Hand-in-Hand-HTML/blob/master/index.html) file. The code you see should be quite similar to the website that you just opened. This `index.html` file is what rendered the page you just saw!
