# CSS Styled Webpage

*Disclaimer*: This folder is for use with lesson 4 only

In lessons 1 and 2, you learned about the basics of HTML, creating your own webpage in this repository called index.html. In this folder, you will use your new skills if CSS combined with HTML to
create a new webpage that is styled using CSS. Also, using HTML links, we can connect the two webpages so create a multi-page website, one styled with CSS and one with just plain HTML.
